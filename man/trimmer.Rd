trimmer(

  idname,
  gname,
  xformla,
  data,
  control_group = "notyettreated",
  threshold = 0.999
)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{is a particular group (below I pass in 2009)}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{gname}{The name of the variable in \code{data} that
contains the first period when a particular observation is treated.
This should be a positive number for all observations in treated groups.
It defines which "group" a unit belongs to.  It should be 0 for units
in the untreated group.}

\item{xformla}{A formula for the covariates to include in the
model.  It should be of the form \code{~ X1 + X2}.  Default
is NULL which is equivalent to \code{xformla=~1}.  This is
used to create a matrix of covariates which is then passed
to the 2x2 DID estimator chosen in \code{est_method}.

For time-varying covariates: (1) With balanced panel data,
in each 2x2 comparison, the covariates
are taken to be the value of the covariates in the earlier time
period, and all of the underlying computation involve change in Y
as a function of those values of covariates.  (2) With repeated cross
sections data and unbalanced panel data, the covariates are taken
from each time period and computations involve Y_post conditional
on X_post minus Y_pre conditional on X_pre.  A byproduct of this
is that, with balanced panel data and in the presence of
time-varying covariates, it is possible to get different numerical
results according to whether or not \code{allow_unbalanced_panel=TRUE} or
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{control_group}{Which units to use the control group.
The default is "nevertreated" which sets the control group
to be the group of units that never participate in the
treatment.  This group does not change across groups or
time periods.  The other option is to set
\code{group="notyettreated"}.  In this case, the control group
is set to the group of units that have not yet participated
in the treatment in that time period.  This includes all
never treated units, but it includes additional units that
eventually participate in the treatment, but have not
participated yet.}

\item{threshold}{the cutoff for which observations are flagged as
likely violators of the support condition.}
}
\value{
list of ids of observations that likely violate support conditions
}
\description{
A utility function to find observations that appear
to violate support conditions.  This function is not called
anywhere in the code, but it is just useful for debugging some
common issues that users run into.

number of units (which may be different from the number
of rows in a panel dataset).}

\item{nG}{The number of groups}

\item{nT}{The number of time periods}

\item{tlist}{a vector containing each time period}

\item{glist}{a vector containing each group}

\item{true_repeated_cross_sections}{Whether or not the data really
is repeated cross sections.  (We include this because unbalanced
panel code runs through the repeated cross sections code)}

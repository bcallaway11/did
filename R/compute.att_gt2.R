#' @title Compute Group-Time Average Treatment Effects
#'
#' @description `compute.att_gt` does the main work for computing
#'  multiperiod group-time average treatment effects
#'
#' @param dp A DIDparams object
#'
#' @return a list with length equal to the number of groups times the
#'  number of time periods; each element of the list contains an
#'  object that contains group-time average treatment effect as well
#'  as which group it is for and which time period it is for. It also exports
#'  the influence function which is used externally to compute
#'  standard errors.

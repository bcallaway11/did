      These articles provide a general introduction to DiD with multiple time periods, an introduction to the R **did** package for estimating treatment effects,
      and details on how to use the **did** package to pre-test the parallel trends assumption underlying the DiD approach. We also provide a discussion on how
      one can build on the framework we put forward in Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) and implemented in this package.

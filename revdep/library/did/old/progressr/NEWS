Package: progressr
==================

Version: 0.9.0 [2021-09-24]

PERFORMANCE:

 * The progressor function created by progressor() no longer "inherit" objects
   from the calling environment, which would, for instance, result in those
   objects to be exported to parallel workers together with the progressor
   function, which in turn would come with large time and memory costs.
   
 * progressor() no longer records the call stack for progressions by default,
   because that significantly increases the size of these condition objects,
   e.g. instead of being 5 kB it may be 500 kB.  If a large number of progress
   updates are signaled and collected, as done, for instance, by futures, then
   the memory consumption on the collecting end could become very large. The
   large sizes would also have a negative impact on the performance in
   parallelization with futures because of the extra overhead of transferring
   these extra large conditions from the parallel workers back to the main R
   session.  These issues has been there since progressr 0.7.0 (December 2020).
   To revert to the previous behavior, use progressor(..., trace = TRUE).

NEW FEATURES:

 * progressor() gained argument 'trace' to control whether or not the call
   stack should be recorded in each progression condition.
   
 * Now print() for 'progressor' functions and 'progression' conditions report
   also on the size of the object, i.e. the number of bytes it requires when
   serialized, for instance, to and from a parallel worker.

BUG FIXES:

 * Registered progression handlers would report on progress also when in a
   _forked_ parallel child processes, e.g. when using parallel::mclapply().
   This would give a false impression that progressr updates would work when
   using parallel::mclapply(), which is not true. Note however, that it does
   indeed work when using the future 'multicore' backend, which uses forks.


Version: 0.8.0 [2021-06-09]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Creating a new progressor() will now automatically finish an existing
   progressor, if one was previously created in the same environment.  The
   previous behavior was to give an error (see below bug fix).

 * R_PROGRESSR_* environment variables are now only read when the 'progressr'
   package is loaded, where they set the corresponding progressr.* option.
   Previously, some of these environment variables were queried by different
   functions as a fallback to when an option was not set.  By only parsing
   them when the package is loaded, it decrease the overhead in functions,
   and it clarifies that options can be changed at runtime whereas environment
   variables should only be set at startup.

 * When using withProgressShiny(), progression messages now updates the
   'detail' component of the Shiny progress panel.  Previously, it updated
   the 'message' component. This can be configured via new 'inputs' argument.
 
NEW FEATURES:

 * withProgressShiny() gained argument 'inputs', which can be used to control
   whether or not Shiny progress components 'message' and 'detail' should be
   updated based on the progression message, e.g.
   inputs = list(message = "sticky_message", detail = "message") will cause
   progression messages to update the 'detail' component and sticky ones
   to update both.
   
 * Now supporting zero-length progressors, e.g. p <- progressor(along = x)
   where length(x) == 0.
   
 * Add handlers("rstudio") to report on progress in the RStudio Console via
   the RStudio Job interface.

BETA FEATURES:

 * As an alternative to specifying the relative amount of progress, say, 
   p(amount = 2), it is now possible to also specify the absolute amount of
   progress made this far, e.g. p(step = 42).  Argument 'amount' has not
   effect when argument 'step' is specified.  WARNING: Argument 'step' should
   only be used when in full control of the order when this progression
   condition is signaled.  For example, it must not be signaled as one of many
   parallel progress updates signaled concurrently, because we cannot guarantee
   the order these progressions arrive.

BUG FIXES:

 * In progressr 0.7.0, any attempt to use more than one progressor inside a
   function or a local() call would result in: Error in assign("...progressor",
   value = fcn, envir = envir) : cannot change value of locked binding for
   '...progressor'.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Function progress() is deprecated in order to re-use it for other purpose.
   It is unlikely that anyone really used this function, but if you did, then
   use cond <- progression() to create 'progression' condition and then use
   withRestart(signalCondition(cond), muffleProgression = function(p) NULL)
   to signal it.
   

Version: 0.7.0 [2020-12-11]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * The user can now use handlers(global = TRUE) to enable progress reports
   everywhere without having to use with_progress().  This only works in
   R (>= 4.0.0) because it requires global calling handlers.

 * with_progress() now reports on progress from multiple consecutive
   progressors, e.g. with_progress({ a <- slow_sum(1:3); b <- slow_sum(1:3) }).

 * A progressor must not be created in the global environment unless wrapped
   in with_progress() or without_progress() call.  Ideally, a progressor is
   created within a function or a local() environment.

 * Package now requires R (>= 3.5.0) in order to protect against interrupts.

NEW FEATURES:

 * progressor() gained argument 'enable' to control whether or not the
   progressor signals 'progression' conditions.  It defaults to option
   'progressr.enable' so that progress updates can be disabled globally.
   The 'enable' argument makes it easy for package developers who already
   provide a 'progress = TRUE/FALSE' argument in their functions to migrate
   to the 'progressr' package without having to change their existing API,
   e.g. the setup becomes 'p <- progressor(along = x, enabled = progress)'.
   The p() function created by p <- progressor(..., enable = FALSE) is an
   empty function with near-zero overhead.

 * Now with_progress() and without_progress() returns the value of the
   evaluated expression.
   
 * The progression message can now be created dynamically based on the
   information in the 'progression' condition.  Specifically, if 'message' is
   a function, then that function will called with the 'progression' condition
   as the first argument. This function should return a character string.
   Importantly, it is only when the progression handler receives the
   progression update and calls conditionMessage(p) on it that this function
   is called.
   
 * progressor() gained argument 'message' to set the default message of all
   progression updates, unless otherwise specified.

 * progressor() gained argument 'on_exit = TRUE'.

 * Now the 'progress' handler shows also a spinner by default.
 
 * Add the 'pbcol' handler, which renders the progress as a colored progress
   bar in the terminal with any messages written in the front.

 * Progression handlers now return invisibly whether or not they are finished.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * Zero-amount progress updates never reached the progress handlers.
 
 * Argument 'enable' for with_progress() had no effect.
 

Version: 0.6.0 [2020-05-18]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now with_progress() makes sure that any output produced while reporting on
   progress will not interfere with the progress output and vice versa, which
   otherwise is a common problem with progress frameworks that output to the
   terminal, e.g. progress-bar output is interweaved with printed objects.
   In contrast, when using 'progressr' we can use message() and print() as
   usual regardless of progress being reported or not.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Signaling progress(msg, class = "sticky") will cause the message to be
   sticky, e.g. for progress bars outputting to the terminal, the message
   will be "pushed" above the progress bar.

 * with_progress() gained argument 'delay_terminal' whose default will be
   automatically inferred from inspecting the currently set handlers and
   whether they output to the terminal or not.

 * Arguments 'delay_stdout' and 'delay_conditions' for with_progress() is
   now agile to the effective value of the 'delay_terminal' argument.

 * Now handler_nnn() functions pass additional arguments in '...' to the
   underlying progress-handler backend, e.g. handler_progress(width = 40L)
   will set up progress::progress_bar$new(width = 40L).
 
 * Add environment variables 'R_PROGRESSR_CLEAR', 'R_PROGRESSR_ENABLE',
   'R_PROGRESSR_ENABLE_AFTER', 'R_PROGRESSR_TIMES', and 'R_PROGRESSR_INTERVAL'
   for controlling the default value of the corresponding 'progressr.*' options.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * Limiting the frequency of progress reporting via handler arguments 'times',
   'interval' or 'intrusiveness' did not work and was effectively ignored.
   
 * The 'progress' handler, which uses progress::progress_bar(), did not support
   colorization of the 'format' string when done by the 'crayon' package.

 * handlers() did not return invisible (as documented).

 * Argument 'target' was ignored for all handler functions.

 * Argument 'interval' was ignored for handler_debug().

 * The class of handler_nnn() functions where all "reset_progression_handler"
   rather than "nnn_progression_handler".  The same bug caused the reported
   'name' field to be "reset" rather than "nnn".
 

Version: 0.5.0 [2020-04-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add 'void' progression handler.

BUG FIXES:

 * Only the last of multiple progression handlers registered was used.


Version: 0.4.0 [2020-01-22]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * All progression handler function have been renamed from <name>_handler()
   to handler_<name>() to make it easier to use autocompletion on them.


Version: 0.3.0 [2020-01-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * progressor() gained arguments 'offset' and 'scale', and 'transform'.

 * handlers() gained argument 'append' to make it easier to append handlers.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * A progression condition with amount = 0 would not update the message.

 
Version: 0.2.1 [2020-01-04]

BUG FIXES:

 * winprogressbar_handler() would produce error "invalid 'Label' argument".

 * handlers() did not return a list if the 'default' handler was returned.
 

Version: 0.2.0 [2020-01-04]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Renamed  withProgress2() to withProgressShiny().

NEW FEATURES:

 * handlers() gained argument 'default' specifying a progression handler to
   be returned if none is set.


Version: 0.1.5 [2019-10-26]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add withProgress2(), which is a plug-in backward compatibility replacement
   for shiny::withProgress() wrapped in progressr::with_progress() where the
   the "shiny" progression handler is by default added to the list of
   progression handlers used.

 * Add demo("mandelbrot", package = "progressr").

BUG FIXES:

 * Package could set '.Random.seed' to NULL, instead of removing it, which in
   turn would produce a warning on "'.Random.seed' is not an integer vector but
   of type 'NULL', so ignored" when the next random number generated.


Version: 0.1.4 [2019-07-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add support for progressor(along = ...).
 

Version: 0.1.3 [2019-07-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now it is possible to send "I'm still here" progression updates by setting
   the progress step to zero, e.g. progress(amount = 0).  This type of
   information can for instance be used to updated a progress bar spinner.

 * Add utility function handlers() for controlling option 'progressr.handlers'.
 
 * Progression handlers' internal state now has a sticky 'message' field,
   which hold the most recent, non-empty progression 'message' received.


Version: 0.1.2 [2019-06-14]

NEW FEATURES:

 * with_progress() gained arguments 'enable' and 'interval' as an alternative
   to setting corresponding options progressr.*.

 * Now option 'progressr.interval' defaults to 0.0 (was 0.5 seconds).

 * Added print() for 'progression_handler' objects.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * with_progress(..., delay_conditions = "condition"), introduced in v0.1.0,
   would also capture conditions produced by progression handlers, e.g.
   progress::progress_bar() output would not be displayed until the very end.


Version: 0.1.1 [2019-06-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 * with_progress() now captures standard output and conditions and relay them
   at then end.  This is done in order to avoid interweaving such output with
   the output produced by the progression handlers.  This behavior can be
   controlled by arguments 'delay_stdout' and 'delay_condition'.
 

Version: 0.1.0 [2019-06-07]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now a progression condition is identified from the R session UUID,
   the progressor UUID, the incremental progression index, and the
   progression timestamp.
   
BUG FIXES:

 * A progressor object that was exported to the same external R process
   multiple times would produce progression conditions that was
   non-distinguishable from those previously exported. Adding a timestamp
   to the progression condition makes them distinguishable.


Version: 0.0.6 [2019-06-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add print() for progression conditions and progressor functions.

 * Now the progressors record more details on the session information.
   This information is passed along with all progression conditions as
   part of the internal owner information.
 

Version: 0.0.5 [2019-05-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add filesize_handler progression handler.
 
 * Add support for times = 1L for progression handlers which when used will
   cause the progression to only be presented upon completion (= last step).

 * The 'shutdown' control_progression signaled by with_progress() on exit
   now contains the 'status' of the evaluation.  If the evaluation was
   successful, then status = "ok", otherwise "incomplete".  Examples
   of incomplete evaluations are errors and interrupts.
   

Version: 0.0.4 [2019-05-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add utils::winProgressBar() progression handler for MS Windows.
 
 * Add support for silent sounds for beepr::beep().

 * Add option 'progressr.enable', which defaults to interactive().

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: Increased package test coverage of progression handlers by running
   all code except the last step that calls the backend, which may not be
   installed or supported on the current platform, e.g. tcltk, beepr,
   notifier.

BUG FIXES:

 * Precreated progression handlers could only be used once.

 * with_progress(..., cleanup = TRUE) requires a withRestart() such that also
   "shutdown" progressions can be muffled.
 

Version: 0.0.3 [2019-05-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add argument 'enable_after' for progression handlers.
 
 * Now with_progress(..., cleanup = TRUE) will signal a generic "shutdown"
   progression at the end that will trigger all progression handlers to
   finish up regardless of all steps have been take or not.

 * Now progressions originating from an unknown source are ignored.
 
 * The default output format of the progress::progress_bar() progression
   handler is now ":percent :bar :message".

 * The tcltk::tkProgressBar() progression handler now displays the
   progression message.

 * Now the progression condition itself is passed to the progression
   reporter functions.
   
 * Add debug_handler for prototyping and debugging purposes.

 * Add newline_handler to add newlines between output of multiple handlers.

 * Argument 'intrusiveness' may now be zero. Previously it had to be
   a strictly positive value.

 * Add without_progress() - which causes all progression conditions to
   be muffled and ignored.
   
BUG FIXES:

 * Progressor functions could produce progression conditions that had
   the same identifiers and therefore would be considered duplicates
   such that progression handlers would ignore them.

 * It was an error if a progression took a step big enough to skip more
   than the next milestone.

 * Progression handlers now keep the internal 'step' field within
   [0, max_steps] in case of a too big progression step is taken.

 * Progression updates received after progression handler is finished
   would keep increasing the internal step field.
 

Version: 0.0.2 [2019-05-15]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Renamed restart 'consume_progression' to 'muffleProgression' to align
   with restarts 'muffleMessage' and 'muffleWarning' in base R.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add a plyr-compatible "progress bar" named progress_progressr().

 * Add option 'progressr.clear'.

 * Visual progression handler will now always render the complete update state
   when 'clear' is FALSE.

 * Now progression handlers ignore a re-signaled progression condition if it
   has already been processed previously.
 
 * Now each progression condition holds unique identifiers for the R session
   and for the progressor that produced the condition.  It also contains an
   unique index per progressor that is incremented whenever a new progression
   condition is created.


Version: 0.0.1 [2019-05-08]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * First decent prototype of this package and the idea behind it.
 
 * Make 'auto_done = TRUE' the default.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9004 [2019-05-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add argument 'auto_done' to automatically have progress updates also
   signal "done" as soon as the last step has been reached.

 * Made 'amount' the first argument of progressors to avoid having to specify
   it by name if progressing with an amount than the default 'amount = 1.0'.

 * Add argument 'clear' to control whether progress reporter should clear
   its output upon completion.  The default is to do this, where supported.

 * Add progress update handler based on pbmcapply::progressBar().

 * Each achieved step is now timestamped.

 * Add option 'progressr.debug'.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9003 [2019-05-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add 'intrusiveness' parameter that specifies how intrusive/disruptive a
   certain progress reporter is.  For instance, an auditory reporter is
   relatively more disruptive than a visual progress bar part of the
   status bar.

 * Simplified the API for creating new types of progress reporters.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9002 [2019-04-25]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add progressor().

 * Add progress_aggregator().


Version: 0.0.0-9001 [2019-04-24]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add progress update handlers based on utils::txtProgressBar(),
   tcltk::tkProgressBar(), cat("\a"), progress::progress_bar(), beepr::beep(),
   and notifier::notify().

 * Add with_progress().

 * Add options 'progressr.handlers' for settings default progress handlers.

 * Add 'progressr.times' for controlling the number of times progress
   updates are rendered.

 * Add 'progressr.interval' for controlling the minimum number of seconds
   that needs to elapse before reporting on the next update.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9000 [2019-04-11]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add progress() to create and signal progression condition.

 * Add progression() to create progression condition.

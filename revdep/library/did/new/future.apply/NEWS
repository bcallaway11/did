Package: future.apply
=====================

Version: 1.8.1 [2021-08-09]

BUG FIX:

 * citEntry() in CITATION used argument 'notes' instead of 'note'.
 

Version: 1.8.0 [2021-08-09]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add argument 'future.envir' to all future_nnn() functions, which is passed
   as argument 'envir' to future().

 * Add option 'future.apply.debug' for debugging features specific to this
   package.  It defaults to option 'future.debug'.
 
PERFORMANCE:

 * Internal getGlobalsAndPackagesXApply() now avoids calculating the object
   size of '...' arguments if option 'future.globals.maxSize' is +Inf.

BUG FIX:

 * f <- function(...) future_lapply(X, function(x) list(...)); f(a=1) would
   produce an error on 'unused argument (a = 1)" with the upcoming release
   of future 1.22.0.
 

Version: 1.7.0 [2021-01-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * The automatic capturing of conditions can be disabled by specifying
   'future.conditions = NULL'.

 * Warnings and errors on using the RNG without specifying 'future.seed'
   are now tailored to the 'future.apply' package.


Version: 1.6.0 [2020-06-30]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * future_apply() gained argument 'simplify', which is added to R-devel
   (to become R 4.1.0).

BUG FIXES:

 * future_apply(X, FUN, ...) would pass all 'future.*' arguments except
   'future.globals', 'future.packages', and 'future.labels' to the 'FUN'
   function instead of processing them locally.  This would often result in
   the 'FUN' producing an error on "unused argument".  It also affected
   'future.seed' not being applied, which means for some 'FUN' functions
   that did not produce this error, non-reproducible results could have
   been produced.
   

Version: 1.5.0 [2020-04-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add future_.mapply() corresponding to .mapply() in the 'base' package.

BUG FIXES:

 * future_mapply() would chunk up 'MoreArgs' when future.seed = TRUE.
 

Version: 1.4.0 [2020-01-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now all future_nnn() functions set a label on each future that reflects the
   name of the future_nnn() function and the index of the chunk, e.g.
   'future_lapply-3'. The format can be controlled by argument 'future.label'.

PERFORMANCE:

 * The assertion of the maximum size of globals per chunk is now significantly
   faster for future_apply().

BUG FIXES:

 * future_lapply(X) and future_mapply(FUN, X) would drop 'names' argument of
   the returned empty list when length(X) == 0.

 * Package could set '.Random.seed' to NULL, instead of removing it, which in
   turn would produce a warning on "'.Random.seed' is not an integer vector but
   of type 'NULL', so ignored" when the next random number generated.
 

Version: 1.3.0 [2019-06-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now 'future.conditions' defaults to the same as argument 'conditions'
   of future::future().  If the latter changes, this package will follow.
 
 * Debug messages are now prepended with a timestamp.

BUG FIXES:

 * The error "sprintf(...) : 'fmt' length exceeds maximal format length 8192"
   could be produced when debugging tried to report on too many globals.
 

Version: 1.2.0 [2019-03-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added future_by().

BUG FIXES:

 * Attributes 'add' and 'ignore' of argument 'future.globals' were ignored
   although support for them was added in future (>= 1.10.0).

 * Validation of L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG seeds failed in recent R devel.
 

Version: 1.1.0 [2019-01-16]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Added argument 'future.stdout' and 'future.conditions' for controlling
   whether standard output and conditions (e.g. messages and warnings) produced
   during the evaluation of futures should be captured and relayed or not.
   Standard output is guaranteed to be relayed in the same order as it would
   when using sequential processing.  Analogously for conditions.  However,
   standard output is always relayed before conditions.  Errors are always
   relayed.  Relaying of non-error conditions requires future (>= 1.11.0).
   
NEW FEATURES:

 * Elements can be processed in random order by setting attribute 'ordering'
   to "random" of argument 'future.chunk.size' or 'future.scheduling', e.g.
   future.chunk.size = structure(TRUE, ordering = "random").  This can help
   improve load balancing in cases where there is a correlation between
   processing time and ordering of the elements.  Note that the order of the
   returned values is not affected when randomizing the processing order.
 
 * Swapped order of arguments 'future.lazy' and 'future.seed' to be consistent
   with ditto arguments of future::future().
 

Version: 1.0.1 [2018-08-26]

DOCUMENTATION / LICENCE:

 * The license is GPL (>= 2).  Previously it was documented as GPL (>= 2.1)
   but that is a non-existing GPL version.

BUG FIXES:

 * For list objects 'X' where X != as.list(X), future_lapply(X) did not
   give the same result as lapply(X).  Analogously for future_vapply(X).
   
 * future_mapply() could drop class attribute on elements iterated over,
   because .subset() was used internally instead of `[`().  For instance,
   iteration over Date objects were affected.


Version: 1.0.0 [2018-06-19]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * License changed from LGPL (>= 2.1) to GPL (>= 2) to make sure it is
   compatible with the source code adopted from R base's apply(), Map(),
   replicate(), sapply(), and tapply(), which are all GPL (>= 2).
 
NEW FEATURES:

 * Added future_apply(), future_mapply(), and future_Map().

 * Added argument `future.chunk.size` as an alternative to argument
   `future.scheduling` for controlling the average number of elements
   processed per future ("chunk").  In R 3.5.0, the parallel package
   introduced argument 'chunk.size'.

 * The maximum total size of globals allowed (option 'future.globals.maxSize')
   per future ("chunk") is now scaled up by the number of elements processed by
   the future ("chunk") making the protection approximately invariant to the
   amount of chunking (arguments 'future.scheduling' and 'future.chunk.size').
 
BUG FIXES:

 * future_lapply(X, ...) did not search for globals in 'X'.

 * future_vapply() did not return the same dimension names as vapply() when
   FUN.VALUE had no names but FUN(X[[1]]) had.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Test code coverage is 100%.
 
 
Version: 0.2.0 [2018-05-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added future_eapply(), future_tapply(), future_vapply(), and
   future_replicate().
 

Version: 0.1.0 [2018-01-15]

 * Package submitted to CRAN.


Version: 0.0.3 [2017-12-06]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Vignette now covers the basics of the package and describes its role
   in the R package ecosystem together with a road map going forward.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added more package tests.  Code coverage is currently at 100%.


Version: 0.0.2 [2017-12-06]

PERFORMANCE:

 * future_lapply(x, ...) is now much faster and more memory efficient for
   large 'x' vectors because it uses internal fold() function that is more
   efficient (memory and speed) version of base::Reduce(f, x), especially
   when length(x) is large.


Version: 0.0.0-9000 [2017-08-31]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added future_sapply().

 * Added future_lapply() - originally from the future package.
 
 * Created package.
